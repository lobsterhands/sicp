Learning from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Resources
I'm following along with the following:
* free HTML version of the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml) book
* the MIT lectures for [Computer Science 61A](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=title)

## Setup
The MIT lectures use a specific implementation of Scheme called STK, which I found on [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/downloads/simply/simply.scm) berkeley.edu.

I have downloaded the file into `stk/simply.scm`.

From your terminal, you can now run `scheme -load stk/simply.scm`.

Now, `(first (first '(hello world)))` evaluates to `h`.
